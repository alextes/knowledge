## Business thinking
### What is our market? Is it growing?

Our market is either money moving into crypto or retail investors investing into crypto. Retail seems to have all but collapsed. Money market might be growing, need to investigate more. Ethereum being seen in the best possible light is good for the whole network. We're the Ethereum marketing effort.

### Pick something that matters

This one is easy for Ethereum but perhaps undercommunicated. Why does Ethereum matter in the larger world, why does it matter against the other 100 blockchains.
