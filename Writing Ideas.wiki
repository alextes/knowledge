# Writing Ideas

- How imagination shapes the world. (thoughts matter, stupid.)
    - In the social world we have learned to behave. As a three year old, endless altercations with the world showed you your limits. You cannot make food appear with your mind, and others feel they have equal rights to play with toys.
- On the power of sex. (Boobs don't just feed babies.)
    - On the offence taken when a man dare gawk at a low-cut top.
- All humans are robots. 
    - We're all machines. Eyes don't shine light, lamps do.
